## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or above)
- npm (Node Package Manager, typically installed with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the Vite development server and open the application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source code will automatically trigger a hot module replacement and update the browser.

5. Begin editing the React components in the `src` directory. You can create new components, import CSS files, or utilize any other features provided by React and Vite.

6. When you're ready to build your application for production, use the following command:

   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```

   This will generate an optimized and minified build of your application in the `dist` directory.

## Project Structure

```
├── dist/              # Build output directory
├── node_modules/      # Project dependencies
├── public/            # Public assets (e.g., HTML, favicon)
├── src/               # Source code directory
│   ├── components/    # React components
│   ├── App.css        # Component-specific styles
│   ├── App.jsx        # Main application component
│   └── index.jsx      # Entry point for the application
├── .gitignore         # Git ignore file
├── index.html         # HTML template
├── package.json       # Project configuration
└── vite.config.js     # Vite configuration
```

The `src` directory is where you'll primarily work with your React components. The `index.jsx` file serves as the entry point for the application and mounts the `App` component.

The `public` directory contains static assets such as the HTML template (`index.html`) and any other files you want to be served as-is without being processed by Vite.

The `dist` directory is automatically generated when you run the build command and contains the optimized production build of your application.
