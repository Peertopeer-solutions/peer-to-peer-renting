<h2 class="text-2xl text-grey-900 my-3">1. Welcome to Rentivity</h2>
    <p>1.1 Rentivity operates a platform that allows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) users to advertise items for rent (such users being "lenders") and for sale (such users being "sellers");</li>
      <li>(b) lenders and sellers to communicate with and enter into agreements with other users to rent or buy such items
        (such users that borrow being "borrowers", and such users that buy being "buyers");</li>
      <li>(c) borrowers to pay lenders for renting the relevant items; and</li>
      <li>(d) buyers to pay sellers for buying the relevant items; and</li>
      <li>(e) users to resolve disputes concerning the hired items,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>which we make available to you through the Rentivity application available for download on your mobile device (the
      "Rentivity App") and our website at rentivity.in (together, the "Rentivity Service").</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-grey-900 my-3">2. Important warnings about lending and hiring items</h2>
    <p>2.1 Rentivity only provides a platform that enables users to borrow and lend items, but does not borrow or lend
      items itself. We also do not regularly monitor the quality of the items made available for hire by lenders through
      the Rentivity Service.</p>
    <p>2.2 As such, the lender (and not us) is responsible for ensuring that items conform to any descriptions provided,
      are fit for purpose, and safe to use. If you are a borrower, we will not be responsible to you for any items that
      you hire through the Rentivity Service.</p>
    <p>2.3 If you are a lender, you will also be responsible for complying with any obligations you may have under
      applicable law with respect to the items that you provide for hire, including giving effect to borrowers' rights
      under applicable consumer law and compensating any damage to the borrower or any other person caused by your
      items.</p>
    <p>2.4 If you are a borrower, you will be responsible for any items you hire through the Rentivity Service, including
      compensating the lender for any loss or damage to those items. You will also be responsible for complying with any
      obligations you may have under applicable law with respect to the use of the items you hire and compensating any
      damage to the lender's items or any other person caused by your use of those items.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl grey-900 my-3">Seller Specific Terms</h2>
    <p class="text-sm">
      12.1 This paragraph 12 applies to you if you are a seller.
      <br />
      12.2 By listing items for sale on the Fat Llama Service, you agree to provide accurate and up-to-date information about
      the items you list.
      <br />
      12.3 You warrant that:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-sm">
      <li>The items you list are owned by you and you have the right to sell them.</li>
      <li>The items you list are not stolen or counterfeit.</li>
      <li>The items you list are in good working condition (unless stated otherwise).</li>
      <li>The items you advertise on the Fat Llama Service conform in all material respects to any pictures or descriptions
        that you upload.</li>
      <li>The items you advertise on the Fat Llama Service can be legally offered for sale.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-sm">
      12.4 You will be responsible for being aware of and complying with all applicable law regulating you as a seller in your
      country.
      <br />
      12.5 You are free to agree any other terms on which you sell an item to a buyer, including the price you wish to charge
      to the buyer for buying your item (the "Sale Price"). When you post items for sale on the Fat Llama Service, you must
      ensure that the Sale Price you advertise on your listing is the total price payable for buying your items, including any
      applicable taxes or costs of delivery.
      <br />
      12.6 Once you agree the terms on which you will sell an item to a buyer, you must not try to amend those terms (including
      the price) unless you have a valid, justifiable reason for doing so and the buyer agrees to those amended terms.
      <br />
      12.7 You can remove a listing or cancel your agreement to sell an item to a buyer at any time before the buyer has paid
      for the item. Once the buyer has sent the payment, the ownership of the item is transferred to the buyer and you are
      committed to delivering the item to them.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl grey-900 my-3">Buyer Specific Terms</h2>
    <p class="text-sm">
      13.1 This paragraph 13 applies to you if you are a buyer.
      <br/>
      13.2 When you agree to buy an item with a seller, the seller grants you ownership of the item in return for the agreed
      Sale Price. Your ownership of this item becomes effective once you have paid for the item. This right is personal to you
      and you are not allowed to give this right to any other person.
      <br/>
      13.3 You are responsible for ensuring that:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-sm">
      <li>You are legally allowed to buy any item that you purchase through the Fat Llama Service.</li>
      <li>You comply with all applicable law when buying the item.</li>
    </ol>
